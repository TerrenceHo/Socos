These are all the scraping scripts I wrote to practice scraping.  Some of these will not work entirely and were mostly for experiments. 
Any data I stored from scraping are stored in either csv files or text files.  Text files look nicer, but csv files are much easier to use and analysis later.
scrapeSoup.py is the script that takes data from opportunityindex.org and outputs it to a textfile.
scrapeSoup2.py is the script that takes data from opportunityindex.org and outputs it to a csv file.
scrapeSoup3.py is the script that takes any leftover data from opportunityindex.org and outputs it to a csvfile.
CountryData.csv is the file that stores all opportunityindex data for all states.
